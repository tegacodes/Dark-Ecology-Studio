##Smokey the Robot
###Ian Mcconchie

Smokey is a robotic solution to smoking. It operates in popular locations for smoking and when it detects a drop in air quality, it throws cigarette butts at the offending smokers in the vicinity. Taking inspiration from the bad robots of Simone Giertz, this project questions tech solutionism in the face of complex environmental issues.
